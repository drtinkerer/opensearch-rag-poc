# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with relevant external knowledge retrieved from a database. Instead of relying solely on the model's training data, RAG systems retrieve pertinent information and use it as context for generating responses.

## Why Use RAG?

### Limitations of LLMs Alone

1. **Knowledge Cutoff**: LLMs are trained on data up to a specific date
2. **Hallucinations**: Models may generate plausible but incorrect information
3. **No Source Attribution**: Difficult to verify where information comes from
4. **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: Generic models lack specialized expertise
5. **Privacy Concerns**: Cannot train on sensitive proprietary data

### Benefits of RAG

1. **Up-to-date Information**: Access current data without retraining
2. **Reduced Hallucinations**: Grounded responses based on retrieved facts
3. **Source Transparency**: Can cite specific documents
4. **Domain Expertise**: Incorporate specialized knowledge
5. **Cost-Effective**: No need for expensive model fine-tuning
6. **Data Privacy**: Keep sensitive data in your own infrastructure

## RAG Architecture

A typical RAG system consists of three main components:

### 1. Document Ingestion Pipeline

```
Documents → Chunking → Embedding → Vector Store
```

- **Chunking**: Split documents into manageable pieces (e.g., paragraphs, sentences)
- **Embedding**: Convert text chunks into vector representations
- **Indexing**: Store vectors in a searchable database (like OpenSearch)

### 2. Retrieval Component

```
User Query → Embed Query → Search Vector DB → Return Top-K Results
```

- Convert user query into vector embedding
- Search for similar document chunks using k-NN
- Retrieve most relevant chunks (typically 3-10)
- Optionally rerank results for better quality

### 3. Generation Component

```
Retrieved Context + User Query → LLM → Generated Answer
```

- Construct prompt with retrieved context
- Send to LLM (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- Generate contextually-grounded response
- Return answer with source citations

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data

```python
# Example: Load and chunk documents
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=512,
    chunk_overlap=50
)

chunks = splitter.split_documents(documents)
```

### Step 2: Generate Embeddings

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
embeddings = model.encode(chunks)
```

### Step 3: Index in Vector Database

```python
# Store in OpenSearch with k-NN enabled
for chunk, embedding in zip(chunks, embeddings):
    client.index(
        index='knowledge-base',
        body={
            'text': chunk,
            'text_vector': embedding.tolist()
        }
    )
```

### Step 4: Retrieve Relevant Context

```python
# Search for similar documents
query_embedding = model.encode(user_query)
results = client.search(
    index='knowledge-base',
    body={
        'query': {
            'knn': {
                'text_vector': {
                    'vector': query_embedding.tolist(),
                    'k': 5
                }
            }
        }
    }
)
```

### Step 5: Generate Answer

```python
# Build context from results
context = "\n\n".join([hit['_source']['text'] for hit in results])

# Create prompt
prompt = f"""Answer the question based on the context below.

Context:
{context}

Question: {user_query}

Answer:"""

# Send to LLM
answer = llm.generate(prompt)
```

## Advanced RAG Techniques

### Hybrid Search

Combine vector similarity with keyword search (BM25):
- Better handles exact matches and named entities
- Improves recall for diverse queries
- Use Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to merge results

### Reranking

After initial retrieval, rerank results using:
- Cross-encoder models for better relevance
- Diversity algorithms to avoid redundancy
- Query-context matching scores

### Chunking Strategies

Different approaches for splitting documents:
- **Fixed-size**: Simple, uniform chunks
- **Sentence-based**: Natural boundaries
- **Semantic**: Split at topic changes
- **Recursive**: Hierarchical chunking

### Metadata Filtering

Filter retrieved documents by:
- Date ranges (recent information only)
- Document types (PDFs, web pages, etc.)
- Access permissions (user-specific content)
- Confidence scores (quality thresholds)

### Query Enhancement

Improve retrieval quality by:
- **Query expansion**: Add synonyms and related terms
- **HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)**: Generate hypothetical answer first
- **Multi-query**: Generate multiple query variations
- **Decomposition**: Break complex questions into sub-questions

## Evaluation Metrics

### Retrieval Quality

- **Precision@K**: Proportion of relevant docs in top K results
- **Recall@K**: Proportion of all relevant docs retrieved
- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**: Position of first relevant result
- **NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)**: Relevance-weighted ranking

### Generation Quality

- **Faithfulness**: Answer grounded in retrieved context
- **Answer Relevance**: Directly addresses the question
- **Context Relevance**: Retrieved docs are pertinent
- **RAGAS Score**: Combined RAG evaluation metric

## Common Challenges

### Challenge 1: Chunk Size
- Too small: Loss of context
- Too large: Irrelevant information, exceeds token limits
- Solution: Experiment with 256-1024 token chunks

### Challenge 2: Retrieval Accuracy
- Poor results with pure vector search
- Solution: Use hybrid search, reranking, query enhancement

### Challenge 3: Context Length
- Too many chunks exceed LLM context window
- Solution: Limit top-K, use summarization, choose longer-context models

### Challenge 4: Inconsistent Answers
- Different results for similar queries
- Solution: Implement caching, consistent chunk boundaries

### Challenge 5: Latency
- Slow response times
- Solution: Batch embeddings, use faster models, caching, async processing

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Basic RAG before advanced techniques
2. **Quality Data**: Clean, well-structured documents
3. **Right Chunk Size**: Balance context and precision
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track retrieval and generation metrics
5. **User Feedback**: Iterate based on real usage
6. **Source Citation**: Always show retrieved sources
7. **Fallback Handling**: Gracefully handle no-results cases
8. **Security**: Implement proper access controls
9. **Version Control**: Track embedding model changes
10. **A/B Testing**: Compare different configurations

## Use Cases

- **Customer Support**: Knowledge base Q&A
- **Internal Documentation**: Company wiki search
- **Legal/Compliance**: Policy and regulation lookup
- **Healthcare**: Medical literature search
- **E-commerce**: Product information and recommendations
- **Education**: Study materials and tutoring
- **Research**: Scientific paper search and summarization

RAG represents a powerful paradigm for building AI applications that combine the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with the factual accuracy of retrieval systems, creating more reliable and trustworthy AI assistants.
